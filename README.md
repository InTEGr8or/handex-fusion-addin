# Handex Face Transforms

Fusion 360 doesn't provide sufficient transform tools

* Free-Move transforms values are not recorded in the history and cannot be parameterized.
* You can do four separate moves of rotate-x, rotate-y, rotate-z, translate-xyz using parameters.
* Moving a component using the four separate transforms can be done, but it's not recorded and can't be edited.
